### Breaking changes

#### Updated listings structure

As a precondition for supporting multi-dimensional flavors, the structure of listings metadata
has changed:

For example, english listing files have moved:

```
../play/en-US/listing/shortdescription --> ../play/listings/en-US/shortdescription
```

TODO: link to README with new structure, add link to migration tool

#### Removed configuration properties

* `uploadImages`: Since the plugin now makes use of Gradle's caching system and incremental builds
  (#308) to only upload images if they have changed, this property has become obsolete.
* `untrackOld`: With the introduction of conflict resolution strategies (#301), this property has
  become obsolete.
* `errorOnSizeLimit`: The plugin will now always error on size limit to provide deterministic
  behavior.

##### Simplified Service Account credentials API

The `jsonFile` and `pk12File` properties have been replaced with a unified
`serviceAccountCredentials` property.

#### Renamed tasks to follow AGP conventions

For example, `publishApkRelease` -> `publishReleaseApk`. Note: the old tasks are still available for
now, but will be removed in a future release.
